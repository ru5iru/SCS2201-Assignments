## Assignment 01

Problem
Write a program that performs the following tasks using a familiar programming language
(Java/C/C++/Python):
  1. Prompts the user to enter a pattern P to search for, for example “Architecture”.
  2. It then proceeds by reading the module catalogue stored in the file ‘modules.txt’, where
     each line contains the title of one module.
  3. For every line in the file, the program checks whether it contains the search pattern P. If
     yes, it prints out this line. For example, the line corresponding to the ARC1015 module (see
     above) contains the string “Architecture” and should be printed. Note: string matching
     should be case-insensitive, i.e. “Architecture” contains the search string “architecture”.
  4. When all lines have been processed, the program prints the number of found matches.
